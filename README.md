# playwright-automationexercise
Demo project for testing https://www.automationexercise.com

This project is not intended to showcase comprehensive testing strategies or advanced automation techniques. Instead, its primary goal is to support my educational journey with Playwright and demonstrate my current skills in browser automation and locators. As part of this effort, I am building a lightweight web test automation framework entirely from scratch — focusing on clarity, modularity, and hands-on learning. The project reflects my growing expertise with modern testing tools.
